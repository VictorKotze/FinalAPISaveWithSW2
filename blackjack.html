	<h1>History of BlackJack</h1>
	
	<p>The origin of BlackJack is not known, but historians agree that it most likely originated from French Casino in 1700 where it was called "Vingt-et-Un", meaning "Twenty-one."<br>
		Blackjack mainly become popular in the United States from the 1820s and was called 21 mainly from Nevada. <br><br>
		The name "BlackJack" came from casino's trying to make the game more popular
		 through benefits. They offered bonus payouts, including one that paid extra if a blackjack (a jack of spades or clubs) was dealt along with an ace of spades.

	<h1>How to play</h1>
	
	<p>The goal in BlackJack is to get your overall card worth closer than 21 than your enemy. The person who is the nearest to 21 wins, but don't go over 21 because you lose. you can still while being over 21 if your enemy gets a very low number not close to 21.
	<br>To pick up a card press the "Hit" button, when you think you have enough cards press "Stand" to make the enemy pick up it's cards. If you press "Stand" you won't be able to pick up any more cards for your round. If you go over 21 your turn will automatically end and the enemy will play.
